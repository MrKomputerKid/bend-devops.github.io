## Hi! We're Bend DevOps and we love technology. 

Our group is a mix of experts, enthusiasts and students who share a common love of DevOps, programming and everything server-side.

Our goals as a group is to develop talent and foster the growing Tech community in Central Oregon. We encourage Senior engineers to connect with and mentor Junior engineers and students. We also have a discord community where you can bounce your ideas off other engineers and have access to experts outside of your company.

Some of our talks have included: JVM Garbage Collection, CI/CD Build Early Test Immediately, Kubernetes Cluster-API, and more!

Also, there's no need to wait for the meetup to join the discussion! Come hang out with us on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zW3mZU9g9b)!
